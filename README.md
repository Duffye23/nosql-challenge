# nosql-challenge

The point of this challenge was to create a non-sql database and to connect to the provided UK Food database in order to evaluate the ratings data in order to decided where journalists and food critics should focus future articles.</br>
The first part of the challenge was to create the MongoDB database and import the UK Food database.</br>
The challenge specified to do so via the command line, but MngoDB Compass has a feature which bypasses this and makes it much more intuitive. Described below:</br>
Create a new database via the plus symbol and name the database and collection appropriately and clicke "create database".

Next, simply click "Add DATA" and then select the appropriate file type, JSON in this case.

Then, navigate to where the file resides in your storage, and import it into your database.
